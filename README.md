# Crypto-Algo Web Application

A full-stack web application for demonstrating and experimenting with modern cryptographic algorithms, including symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, hashing, and secure key generation.

## Features
- **Symmetric Encryption:** Fernet (AES-based)
- **Asymmetric Encryption:** RSA with OAEP and SHA-256
- **Hashing:** MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA3-256, BLAKE2b
- **Key Generation:** Random key generation (`os.urandom`) and password-based key derivation (PBKDF2 with SHA-256)
- **Modern UI:** Built with React and Material-UI, featuring animated backgrounds and interactive elements
